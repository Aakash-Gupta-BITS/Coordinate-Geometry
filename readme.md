# Coordinate Geometry App

## About the project
In my 12th standard, I was leaning C# and UWP. I wanted to test my new powers (being able to code is the ultimate power) and after some failed attempts, I thought about coordinate geometry chapter of maths in NCERT. This was an interesting chapter which uses direct formulas to find the answers. So, I decided to make an application which will work just like a calculator for coordinate geometry and will help someone/me to cross verify the calculations.

## Objects Covered
1. Lines and various forms of line equation.
2. Circles and various ways to make a circle.
3. Conic sections
   - Parabola.
   - Ellipse.
   - Hyperbola
   
## Discontinuation
The project was complete as far as I remember. But there were few major problems that become relevant in my second year in college:
1. The UI was extremely outdated.
2. The code was not maintainable at all - knowledge is curse. More you know, more you hate your past about wrong decisions.

## Note for future contributors, if any
If you think you can learn from this project/add more features, you are more than welcome and I will be happy to guide you through the project structure. Kindly note that this project was written during my initial learning days of programming, so many best practices are not used here and thus, code can be imporoved significantly.
